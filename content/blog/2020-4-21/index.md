## Passing arguments to a Page Query in Gatsby

When a page is created dynamically from this blog post template in gatsby-node.js, you can provide an object as part of the pageâ€™s context. Keys in the context object that match up with arguments in the page query (in this case: "title"), will be used as variables. Variables are prefaced with $, so passing a title property will become $title in the query.
