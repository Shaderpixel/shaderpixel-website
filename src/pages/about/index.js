              I am
              <br /> Richard Lock
            </h1>
          </AboutHeader>
          <p>
            Richard once aspired to be an author/writer - a 7 year old's
            ambition after too much reading. He also considered archaeology
            after watching Jurassic Park and reading donated copies of National
            Geography magazines from his neighbor while growing up. Despite his
            parent's best intentions to guide him down the path of established
            careers, Richard gravitated towards a career in technology. His
            first taste of technology was when his family acquired a white and
            large boxy x486 computer that ingests toast-sized floppy disks.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike nerd cliches you heard over and over again, Richard is not a
            hacker or and never touch programming until he was in university. He
            grew up playing video games and MUDs. His knack in problem solving
            comes at the expense of his parent's and sibling's despair and
            anguish when he tries to open things up to figure how things work
            and never quite successfully putting them back together again. There
            was a lot of force involved. He also fully admits to deleting the
            system files and accidentally performing a partial reformat of the
            family computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            He also has a strength in planning, strategizing, and executing.
            During his schooling years, Richard always find creating report on
            subjects to be absolute blast. The logical categorization of topics
            and requirements that leads to the eventual conclusion of the
            requested ask was soothing and methodical for him. Sometimes he
            overdelivers on the researched topic and often wonders if his
            teacher actually read through the entire binder report on cell
            division when grading it. His research paper writing during his
            graduate study days also helped him develop a more structured
            approach to problem solving and planning and execution. Today, he
            applies the improved version of his skills as the lead developer of
            his team where he continues to hone his management skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Richard carries a bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science and a
            master's degree in Management Information Systems. His strong
            business and IT background and lends him a unique insight into both
            worlds. He empathizes with both aspects and sees the need for a
            balanced equilibrium between the two in a digitally-driven business
            era.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            In his spare time, Richard indulges in continuous learning by
            keeping up on latest trends in the web development world. He also
            satiates his need for fantasy in a good book and video game now and
            then. You might also find him tending to his garden or doing laps at
            a track field or a pool.
